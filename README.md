## Rails Foundation Checkpoint 50 to test pull requests.

 Made with my mentor at [Bloc](http://bloc.io).

Pull Requests
- create a new branch
- push branch as a branch to origin
- branch is not merged and kept separately
- developer issues a "pull request" on GitHub asking for branch to be merged or pulled into origin/master
- developer reviews the changes and merges the pull request into origin master using the Github interface
- branch is now merged on the origin remote, but developer must now pull this new origin/master branch to local
